	/**

	 * This represents the inverse mapping from range to domain. For a valid value y in the output range, linear(linear.invert(*y*)) equals y; similarly, for a valid value x in the
	 * input domain, linear.invert(linear(*x*)) equals x.
	 * <p>
	 * Equivalently, you can construct the invert operator by building a new scale while swapping the domain and range. The invert operator is particularly useful for interaction,
	 * say to determine the value in the input domain that corresponds to the pixel location under the mouse.
	 * <p>
	 * Note: the invert operator is only supported if the output range is numeric! D3 allows the output range to be any type; under the hood, d3.interpolate or a custom
	 * interpolator of your choice is used to map the normalized parameter t to a value in the output range. Thus, the output range may be colors, strings, or even arbitrary
	 * objects. As there is no facility to "uninterpolate" arbitrary types, the invert operator is currently supported only on numeric ranges.

	 * extrapolation.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, with the default domain and range of [0,1], an input value of 2 will return an output value of 2.
	 * <p>

	// =========== nice ==========

	/**
	 * Extends the domain so that it starts and ends on nice round values.
	 * <p>
	 * This method typically modifies the scale's domain, and may only extend the bounds to the nearest round value.
	 * <p>
	 * The precision of the round value is dependent on the extent of the domain dx according to the following formula: exp(round(log(*dx*)) - 1).
	 * <p>
	 * Nicing is useful if the domain is computed from data and may be irregular.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, for a domain of [0.20147987687960267, 0.996679553296417], the nice domain is [0.2, 1]. If the domain has more than two values, nicing the domain only affects

	 * domain.
